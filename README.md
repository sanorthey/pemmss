### Primary Exploration, Mining and Metal Supply Scenario (PEMMSS) model
This scenario modeling framework evaluates the rates of mine development, mineral exploration and co-product recovery required to meet primary demand over-time.

PEMMSS codebase contributors:
- Stephen.A. Northey | PEMMSS Architect and Lead Developer 
- Jayden Hyman | PEMMSS GUI Developer (app.py) and Expert User 
- Bernardo Mendonca Severiano | PEMMSS Developer (spatial.py) and Expert User

PEMMSS model initial conceptualisation: S.A. Northey, S. Pauliuk, S. Klose, M. Yellishetty, D. Giurco

### How to use:
1. #### Install python and dependent packages
This version of the model has been developed and tested using python 3.13.5. Additional required packages and the version used during development and testing are shown in requirements.txt. Install using pip:

```angular2html
cd <\path_to_pemmss_folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. #### Scenario Data Input and Calibration
Adjust scenario parameters and calibrate the model by modifying the CSV files located in the **input_files/** subdirectory.

The expected structure and data formats for each CSV file are documented in the associated import function defined in modules/file_import.py.

3. #### Execute pemmss.py
Run the model by executing pemmss.py using python.

4. #### View Results Data and Graphs
The results will be saved to a new sub-directory created for model execution, **output_files/[EXECUTION_DATE_TIME]/**

This will include:
- A folder containing copies of the input files used for the model run to ensure reproduceability.
- A folder containing data generated for each demand scenario, with individual results CSVs for each iteration of this.
- A folder containing aggregated statistics from all demand scenarios and iterations.
- A folder containing any generated graphs.
- A log file containing information useful for benchmarking and debugging.

5. #### Alternative GUI interface
Run app.py using python.

Please note that this may not run correctly when ran from IDEs without native Jupyter notebook support such as Pycharm Community version. Has been tested to work with Pycharm Professional, VScode and when ran from the terminal (need to cd into pemmss folder to ensure it is the working directory).
